# Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning for Java

## Why Use Java for AI? 

And more broadly, why should you use JVM languagues like Java, [Scala](./scala-ai.html), Clojure or Kotlin to build AI and machine-learning solutions?

Java is the [most widely used programming language in the world](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/). Large organizations in the public and private sector have enormous Java code bases, and rely heavily on the JVM as a compute environment. In particular, much of the open-source big data stack is written for the JVM. This includes [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) for distributed data management; [Apache Spark](./spark) as a distributed run-time for fast ETL; [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) as a message queue; [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/), [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) and [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) for search; and [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) for data storage to name a few. 

Since access to data is a prequisite to building AI and machine-learning solutions, AI tools need to integrate well with those technologies. AI starts with the data you gather. That's why the AI and machine-learning tooling you choose is crucial. The right tools solve a lot of integration problems (many data science projects fail when prototypes can't integrate with the production stack), and they will accelerate the digital transformation of many of the world's businesses. 

"Accelerating digital transformation" sounds like a bunch of empty buzzwords, so let's paraphrase it. Choosing the right machine learning tools allows you to produce more accurate predictions about your data while using your existing technology stack, and those predictions will allow you to make better decisions for your business. Those predictions might be the basis of a cool new product (self-piloting drones) or lead to big cost savings. We have listed the most important machine-learning tools written in Java below. 

## Deep Learning & Neural Networks

Deep learning usually refers to deep artificial neural networks. [Neural networks](https://deeplearning4j.org/neuralnet-overview) are a type of machine learning algorithm loosely modeled on the neurons in the human brain. Deep neural nets involve stacking several neural nets on top of each other to enable a feature hierarchy for more accurate classification and prediction. Deep learning is the state of the art in most tasks or machine perception, involved classification, clustering and prediction applied to raw sensory data. 

### Eclipse Deeplearning4j

[Eclipse Deeplearning4j](https://deeplearning4j.org/) is the most widely used open source deep learning library for Java and the JVM. It includes [multilayer perceptrons](./multilayerperceptron), [convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image and text classification](./convolutionalnetwork), [recurrent neural networks such as LSTMs for text and time series data](./lstm), and [various autoencoders like VAEs and GANs](./generative-adversarial-network). Its auto-differentiation library, SameDiff, allows developers to create any neural network. It has a Scala API and uses Keras as its optional Python API. The official website provides many tutorials and simple theoretical explanations for deep learning and neural networks. Deeplearning4j includes machine-learning algorithms such as logistic regression and k-neurest neighbors.

### Neuroph

[Neuroph](http://neuroph.sourceforge.net/) is an open-source Java framework for neural networks. Developers can create neural nets with the Neuroph GUI. The Neuroph API documentation also explains how neural networks work.

### Arbiter (Hyperparameter Optimization for Java)

[Eclipse Arbiter](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/arbiter) is a hyperparameter optimization library designed to automate hyperparameter tuning for deep neural net training. It is the equivalent of Google Tensorflow's Vizier, or the Python library Spearmint. Arbiter is part of the Deeplearning4j framework. 

## Expert Systems

An expert system is also called a rules-based system. The rules are typically if-then statements; i.e. if this condition is met, then perform this action. An expert system usually comprises hundreds or thousands of nested if-then statements. Expert systems were a popular form of AI in the 1980s. They are good at modeling static and deterministic relationships; e.g. the tax code. However, they are also brittle and they require manual modification, which can be slow and expensive. Unlike, machine-learning algorithms, they do not adapt as they are exposed to more data. They can be a useful complement to a machine-learning algorithm, codifying the things that should always happen a certain way. 

### Drools

[Drools](https://www.drools.org/) is a business rules management system backed by Red Hat. 

## Natural-Language Processing

Natural language processing (NLP) refers to applications that use computer science, AI and computational linguistics to enable interactions between computers and human languages, both spoken and written. It involves programming computers to process large natural language corpora (sets of documents). 

Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation  (NLG), as well as connecting language, machine perception and dialog systems.

### OpenNLP

[Apache OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/) is a machine-learning toolkit for processing natural language; i.e. text. The official website provides API documentation with information on how to use the library.
