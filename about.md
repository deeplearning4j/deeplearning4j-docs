# About Eclipse Deeplearning4j

Eclipse Deeplearning4j is an open-source, distributed deep-learning project in Java and Scala spearheaded by the people at [Skymind](http://www.skymind.ai), a San Francisco-based business intelligence and enterprise software firm. We're a team of data scientists, deep-learning specialists, Java systems engineers and semi-sentient robots.

There are a lot of knobs to turn when you're training a distributed deep-learning network. We've done our best to explain them, so that Deeplearning4j can serve as a DIY tool for Java, Scala and Clojure programmers working on Hadoop and other file systems. If you require support or customization beyond these tutorials, please contact us at [Skymind](http://www.skymind.ai/contact/). 

Our open-core product, the [Skymind Intelligence Layer](https://docs.skymind.ai/docs/welcome), bundles the Deeplearning4j suite of libraries alongside a Conda environment with Tensorflow, Keras, scikit-learn and other popular machine learning tools. SKIL makes it easy to perform distributed training, testing against production environments, and deployment of trained models to production, automating redundant, everyday workflow tasks faced by data scientists.

## ND4J & ND4S

[ND4J is a scientific computing engine for the JVM](http://nd4j.org/) powering our matrix manipulations, using C++ for large-scale operations. (See its [Github repo here](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/).) [ND4S](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4s) is its Scala wrapper.

## Media

Deeplearning4j has been featured in [Wired](http://www.wired.com/2014/06/skymind-deep-learning/), [GigaOM](http://gigaom.com/2014/06/02/a-startup-called-skymind-launches-pushing-open-source-deep-learning/), [Businessweek](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-06-03/teaching-smaller-companies-how-to-probe-deep-learning-on-their-own), [Venturebeat](http://venturebeat.com/2014/06/02/skymind-launches-with-open-source-plug-and-play-deep-learning-features-for-your-app/), [The Wall Street Journal](http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/06/03/the-morning-download-apple-relies-on-ecosystem-for-innovation/), [Fusion](http://fusion.net/story/177825/privacy-conscious-siris-that-dont-give-up-your-secrets-are-coming/) and [Java Magazine](oraclejavamagazine-digital.com/javamagazine/may_june_2015?sub_id=DJ9kzXBnuXELe#pg58). DL4J workshops are offered through [GalvanizeU](http://www.galvanizeu.com/) in San Francisco.

## Support

Without the engagement of Skymind customers and community, and the generous backing of Skymind's investors -- [Tencent](http://www.tencent.com/en-us/at/managementteam.shtml)'s investment team, led by David Wallerstein; [Liquid 2 Ventures](http://liquid2.vc/); [Mandra Capital](https://angel.co/mandra-capital); [SV Angel](http://svangel.com/); Ullas Naik; [Hemi Ventures](https://www.hemi.vc/); Wei Guo; Ray Lanes's GreatPoint Ventures and others -- Deeplearning4j would not exist in its present form.

# Jobs @Skymind

We hire from our open-source contributors. The best way to apply for a job building the future of deep learning with us is to join our community on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j), fork us on [Github](https://github.com/deeplearning4j), find a problem to work on with us, and we'll can see if there's a fit! Working together is more informative than interviews, and with a little luck it's also more fun. :)
