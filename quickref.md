## <a name="layers-preproc">Input Pre Processors</a>

An InputPreProcessor is a simple class/interface that operates on the input to a layer. That is, a preprocessor is attached to a layer, and performs some operation on the input, before passing the layer to the output. Preprocessors also handle backpropagation - i.e., the preprocessing operations are generally differentiable.

Note that in many cases (such as the XtoYPreProcessor classes), users won't need to (and shouldn't) add these manually, and can instead just use ```.setInputType(InputType.feedForward(10))``` or similar, which whill infer and add the preprocessors as required.

* **CnnToFeedForwardPreProcessor** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/preprocessor/CnnToFeedForwardPreProcessor.java)) - handles the activation reshaping necessary to transition from a CNN layer (ConvolutionLayer, SubsamplingLayer, etc) to DenseLayer/OutputLayer etc.

Note that this transition/preprocessor only makes sense if the activations are actually CNN activations, but have been 'flattened' to a row vector.
* **FeedForwardToRnnPreProcessor** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/preprocessor/FeedForwardToRnnPreProcessor.java)) - handles transition from a (time distributed) feed-forward layer to a RNN layer

# <a name="listeners">Iteration/Training Listeners</a>

IterationListener: can be attached to a model, and are called during training, once after every iteration (i.e., after each parameter update).
TrainingListener: extends IterationListener. Has a number of additional methods are called at different stages of training - i.e., after forward pass, after gradient calculation, at the start/end of each epoch, etc.

Neither type (iteration/training) are called outside of training (i.e., during output or feed-forward methods)


* **ScoreIterationListener** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/optimize/listeners/ScoreIterationListener.java), Javadoc) - Logs the loss function score every N training iterations

# <a name="evaluation">Evaluation</a>

Link: [Main evaluation page](https://deeplearning4j.org/evaluation)

DL4J has a number of classes for evaluating the performance of a network, against a test set. Different evaluation classes are suitable for different types of networks.

* **Evaluation** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/eval/Evaluation.java)) - Used for the evaluation of multi-class classifiers (assumes standard one-hot labels, and softmax probability distribution over N classes for predictions). Calculates a number of metrics - accuracy, precision, recall, F1, F-beta, Matthews correlation coefficient, confusion matrix. Optionally calculates top N accuracy, custom binary decision thresholds, and cost arrays (for non-binary case). Typically used for softmax + mcxent/negative-log-likelihood networks.
* **EvaluationBinary** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/eval/EvaluationBinary.java)) - A multi-label binary version of the Evaluation class. Each network output is assumed to be a separate/independent binary class, with probability 0 to 1 independent of all other outputs. Typically used for sigmoid + binary cross entropy networks.
* **EvaluationCalibration** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/eval/EvaluationCalibration.java)) - Used to evaluation the calibration of a binary or multi-class classifier. Produces reliability diagrams, residual plots, and histograms of probabilities. Export plots to HTML using [EvaluationTools](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-core/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/evaluation/EvaluationTools.java).exportevaluationCalibrationToHtmlFile method

Supports 2 modes: thresholded (approximate) or exact (the default). Calculates area under ROC curve, area under precision-recall curve. Plot ROC and P-R curves to HTML using [EvaluationTools](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-core/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/evaluation/EvaluationTools.java)
* **ROCBinary** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/eval/ROCBinary.java)) - a version of ROC that is used for multi-label binary networks (i.e., sigmoid + binary cross entropy), where each network output is assumed to be an independent binary variable.  
* **ROCMultiClass** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/eval/ROCMultiClass.java)) - a version of ROC that is used for multi-class (non-binary) networks (i.e., softmax + mcxent/negative-log-likelihood networks). As ROC metrics are only defined for binary classification, this treats the multi-class output as a set of 'one-vs-all' binary classification problems.
* **RegressionEvaluation** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/eval/RegressionEvaluation.java)) - An evaluation class used for regression models (including multi-output regression models). Reports metrics such as mean-squared error (MSE), mean-absolute error, etc for each output.


# <a name="saving">Network Saving and Loading</a>

MultiLayerNetwork and ComputationGraph can be saved using the [ModelSerializer](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/util/ModelSerializer.java) class - and specifically the ```writeModel```, ```restoreMultiLayerNetwork``` and ```restoreComputationGraph``` methods.

As of current master (but not 0.9.1) ```MultiLayerNetwork.save(File)``` and ```MultiLayerNetwork.load(File)``` have been added. These use ModelSerializer internally. Similar save/load methods have also been added for ComputationGraph.

Examples: [Saving and loading network](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples/tree/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/misc/modelsaving)

Networks can be trained further after saving and loading: however, be sure to load the 'updater' (i.e., the historical state for updaters like momentum, ). If no futher training is required, the updater state can be ommitted to save disk space and memory.

Most Normalizers (implementing the ND4J ```Normalizer``` interface) can also be added to a model using the ```addNormalizerToModel``` method.

Note that the format used for models in DL4J is .zip: it's possible to open/extract these files using programs supporting the zip format.



# <a name="config">Network Configurations</a>

This section lists the various configuration options that Deeplearning4j supports.

## <a name="config-afn">Activation Functions</a>

Activation functions can be defined in one of two ways:
(a) By passing an [Activation](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/blob/master/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/activations/Activation.java) enumeration value to the configuration - for example, ```.activation(Activation.TANH)```
(b) By passing an [IActivation](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/blob/master/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/activations/IActivation.java) instance - for example, ```.activation(new ActivationSigmoid())```

Note that Deeplearning4j supports custom activation functions, which can be defined by extending [BaseActivationFunction](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/tree/master/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/activations/impl)

## <a name="config-init">Weight Initialization</a>

Weight initialization refers to the method by which the initial parameters for a new network should be set.

Weight initialization are usually defined using the [WeightInit](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/weights/WeightInit.java) enumeration.

Custom weight initializations can be specified using ```.weightInit(WeightInit.DISTRIBUTION).dist(new NormalDistribution(0, 1))``` for example. As for master (but not 0.9.1 release) ```.weightInit(new NormalDistribution(0, 1))``` is also possible, which is equivalent to the previous approach.

Available weight initializations. Not again that not all are available in the 0.9.1 release:

 * **DISTRIBUTION**: Sample weights from a provided distribution (specified via ```dist``` configuration method
 * **ZERO**: Generate weights as zeros
 * **ONES**: All weights are set to 1
 * **SIGMOID_UNIFORM**: A version of XAVIER_UNIFORM for sigmoid activation functions. U(-r,r) with r=4*sqrt(6/(fanIn + fanOut))
 * **NORMAL**: Normal/Gaussian distribution, with mean 0 and standard deviation 1/sqrt(fanIn). This is the initialization recommented in [Klambauer et al. 2017, "Self-Normalizing Neural Network"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02515) paper. Equivalent to DL4J's XAVIER_FAN_IN and LECUN_NORMAL (i.e. Keras' "lecun_normal")
 * **LECUN_UNIFORM**: Uniform U[-a,a] with a=3/sqrt(fanIn).
 * **UNIFORM**: Uniform U[-a,a] with a=1/sqrt(fanIn). "Commonly used heuristic" as per Glorot and Bengio 2010

  * **XAVIER_FAN_IN**: Similar to Xavier, but 1/fanIn -> Caffe originally used this.
 * **RELU**: [He et al. (2015), "Delving Deep into Rectifiers"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852). Normal distribution with variance 2.0/nIn
 * **RELU_UNIFORM**: [He et al. (2015), "Delving Deep into Rectifiers"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852). Uniform distribution U(-s,s) with s = sqrt(6/fanIn)

 * **VAR_SCALING_UNIFORM_FAN_AVG**: Uniform U[-a,a] with a=3.0/((fanIn + fanOut)/2)


## <a name="config-updaters">Updaters (Optimizers)</a>

An 'updater' in DL4J is a class that takes raw gradients and modifies them to become updates. These updates will then be applied to the network parameters.
The [CS231n course notes](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/#ada) have a good explanation of some of these updaters. 

Supported updaters in Deeplearning4j:
* **AdaDelta** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/blob/e92cae4626e2c9cf27d416136f1895b747a32cee/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/learning/config/AdaDelta.java)) - [Reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5701)

* **Nadam** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/blob/e92cae4626e2c9cf27d416136f1895b747a32cee/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/learning/config/Nadam.java)) - A variant of the Adam updater, using the Nesterov mementum update rule - [Reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04747)
* **Nesterovs** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/blob/e92cae4626e2c9cf27d416136f1895b747a32cee/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/learning/config/Nesterovs.java)) - Nesterov momentum updater

That is, gradients are not modified at all by this updater. Mathematically equivalent to the SGD updater with a learning rate of 1.0
* **RmsProp** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/blob/e92cae4626e2c9cf27d416136f1895b747a32cee/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/learning/config/RmsProp.java)) - [Reference - slide 29](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf)
* **Sgd** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/blob/e92cae4626e2c9cf27d416136f1895b747a32cee/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/learning/config/Sgd.java)) - Standard stochastic gradient descent updater. This updater applies a learning rate only.


## <a name="config-schedules">Learning Rate Schedules</a>

All updaters that support a learning rate also support learning rate schedules (the Nesterov momentum updater also supports a momentum schedule). Learning rate schedules can be specified either based on the number of iterations, or the number of epochs that have elapsed. Dropout (see below) can also make use of the schedules listed here.

Configure using, for example: ```.updater(new Adam(new ExponentialSchedule(ScheduleType.ITERATION, 0.1, 0.99 )))```
You can plot/inspect the learning rate that will be used at any point by calling ```ISchedule.valueAt(int iteration, int epoch)``` on the schedule object you have created.

Available schedules:

* **ExponentialSchedule** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/blob/master/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/schedule/ExponentialSchedule.java)) - Implements ```value(i) = initialValue * gamma^i``` 
* **InverseSchedule** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/blob/master/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/schedule/InverseSchedule.java)) - Implements ```value(i) = initialValue * (1 + gamma * i)^(-power)```
* **MapSchedule** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/blob/master/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/schedule/MapSchedule.java)) - Learning rate schedule based on a user-provided map. Note that the provided map must have a value for iteration/epoch 0. Has a builder class to conveniently define a schedule.
* **PolySchedule** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/blob/master/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/schedule/PolySchedule.java)) - Implements ```value(i) = initialValue * (1 + i/maxIter)^(-power)```
* **SigmoidSchedule** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/blob/master/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/schedule/SigmoidSchedule.java)) - Implements ```value(i) = initialValue * 1.0 / (1 + exp(-gamma * (iter - stepSize)))```
* **StepSchedule** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/blob/master/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/schedule/StepSchedule.java)) - Implements ```value(i) = initialValue * gamma^( floor(iter/step) )```


Note that custom schedules can be created by implementing the ISchedule interface.


## <a name="config-regularization">Regularization</a>

### <a name="config-l1l2">L1/L2 Regularization</a>

L1 and L2 regularization can easily be added to a network via the configuration: ```.l1(0.1).l2(0.2)```.
Note that ```.regularization(true)``` must be enabled on 0.9.1 also (this option has been removed after 0.9.1 was released).

L1 and L2 regularization is applied by default on the weight parameters only. That is, .l1 and .l2 will not impact bias parameters - these can be regularized using ```.l1Bias(0.1).l2Bias(0.2)```.


### <a name="config-dropout">Dropout</a>

All dropout types are applied at training time only. They are not applied at test time.

* **Dropout** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/dropout/Dropout.java)) - Each input activation x is independently set to (0, with probability 1-p) or (x/p with probability p)<br>
* **GaussianDropout** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/dropout/GaussianDropout.java)) - This is a multiplicative Gaussian noise (mean 1) on the input activations. Each input activation x is independently set to: ```x * y```, where ```y ~ N(1, stdev = sqrt((1-rate)/rate))```
* **GaussianNoise** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/dropout/GaussianNoise.java)) - Applies additive, mean-zero Gaussian noise to the input - i.e., ```x = x + N(0,stddev)```
* **AlphaDropout** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/dropout/AlphaDropout.java)) - AlphaDropout is a dropout technique proposed by [Klaumbauer et al. 2017 - Self-Normalizing Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02515). Designed for self-normalizing neural networks (SELU activation, NORMAL weight init). Attempts to keep both the mean and variance of the post-dropout activations to the the same (in expectation) as before alpha dropout was applied

Note that (as of current master - but not 0.9.1) the dropout parameters can also be specified according to any of the schedule classes mentioned in the Learning Rate Schedules section.

### <a name="config-weightnoise">Weight Noise</a>

As per dropout, dropconnect / weight noise is applied only at training time

* **DropConnect** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/weightnoise/DropConnect.java)) - DropConnect is similar to dropout, but applied to the parameters of a network (instead of the input activations). [Reference](https://cs.nyu.edu/~wanli/dropc/dropc.pdf)

Both additive and multiplicative modes are supported - when additive, noise should be mean 0, when multiplicative, noise should be mean 1

### <a name="config-constraints">Constraints</a>

Constraints are deterministic limitations that are placed on a model's parameters at the end of each iteration (after the parameter update has occurred). They can be thought of as a type of regularization.

* **MaxNormConstraint** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/constraint/MaxNormConstraint.java)) - Constrain the maximum L2 norm of the incoming weights for each unit to be less than or equal to the specified value. If the L2 norm exceeds the specified value, the weights will be scaled down to satisfy the constraint.
* **MinMaxNormConstraint** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/constraint/MinMaxNormConstraint.java)) - Constrain the minimum AND maximum L2 norm of the incoming weights for each unit to be between the specified values. Weights will be scaled up/down if required.
* **NonNegativeConstraint** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/constraint/NonNegativeConstraint.java)) - Constrain all parameters to be non-negative. Negative parameters will be replaced with 0.
* **UnitNormConstraint** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/b841c0f549194dbdf88b42836df662d9b8ea8c6d/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/constraint/UnitNormConstraint.java)) - Constrain the L2 norm of the incoming weights for each unit to be 1.0. 


# <a name="data">Data Classes</a>

## <a name="data-iter">Iterators</a>

DataSetIterator is an abstraction that DL4J uses to iterate over minibatches of data, used for training. DataSetIterator returns DataSet objects, which are minibatches, and support a maximum of 1 input and 1 output array (INDArray).

MultiDataSetIterator is similar to DataSetIterator, but returns MultiDataSet objects, which can have as many input and output arrays arrays as required for the network.

### <a name="data-iter-builtin">Iterators - Build-In (DL4J-Provided Data)</a>

These iterators download their data as required. The actual datasets they return are not customizable.

* **MnistDataSetIterator** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-data/deeplearning4j-datasets/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/datasets/iterator/impl/MnistDataSetIterator.java)) - DataSetIterator for the well-known MNIST digits dataset. By default, returns a row vector (1x784), with values normalized to 0 to 1 range. Use ```.setInputType(InputType.convolutionalFlat())``` to use with CNNs.
* **EmnistDataSetIterator** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-data/deeplearning4j-datasets/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/datasets/iterator/impl/EmnistDataSetIterator.java)) - Similar to the MNIST digits dataset, but with more examples, and also letters. Includes multiple different splits (letters only, digits only, letters + digits, etc). Same 1x784 format as MNIST, hence (other than different number of labels for some splits) can be used as a drop-in replacement for MnistDataSetIterator.

## <a name="data-datavec">Reading Raw Data: DataVec RecordReaders</a>

[TODO]

## <a name="data-norm">Data Normalization</a>

ND4J provides a number of classes for performing data normalization. These are implemented as DataSetPreProcessors.
The basic pattern for normalization:

1. Create your (unnormalized) DataSetIterator or MultiDataSetIterator: ```DataSetIterator myTrainData = ...```
2. Create the normalizer you want to use: ```NormalizerMinMaxScaler normalizer = new NormalizerMinMaxScaler();```
3. Fit the normalizer: ```normalizer.fit(myTrainData)```
4. Set the normalizer/preprocessor on the iterator: ```myTrainData.setPreProcessor(normalizer);```
End result: the data that comes from your DataSetIterator will now be normalized.

In general, you should fit *only* on the training data, and do ```trainData.setPreProcessor(normalizer)``` and ```testData.setPreProcessor(normalizer)``` with the same/single normalizer that has been fit on the training data only.

Note that where appropriate (NormalizerStandardize, NormalizerMinMaxScaler) statistics such as mean/standard-deviation/min/max are shared across time (for time series) and across image x/y locations (but not depth/channels - for image data). 

Data normalization example: [link](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples/blob/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/dataexamples/PreprocessNormalizerExample.java)

Default settings do 0-255 input to 0-1 output (but is configurable). Note that unlike the other normalizers here, this one does not rely on statistics (mean/min/max etc) collected from the data, hence the ```normalizer.fit(trainData)``` step is unnecessary (is a no-op).
* **NormalizerStandardize** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/blob/master/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/dataset/api/preprocessor/NormalizerStandardize.java)) - normalizes each feature value independently (and optionally label values) to have 0 mean and a standard deviation of 1

* **VGG16ImagePreProcessor** - ([Source](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/blob/master/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/dataset/api/preprocessor/VGG16ImagePreProcessor.java)) - This is a preprocessor specifically for VGG16.

## <a name="data-spark">Spark Network Training Data Classes</a>

[TODO]

# <a name="transfer">Transfer Learning</a>

Deeplearning4j has classes/utilities for performing transfer learning - i.e., taking an existing network, and modifying some of the layers (optionally freezing others so their parameters don't change). For example, an image classifier could be trained on ImageNet, then applied to a new/different dataset. Both MultiLayerNetwork and ComputationGraph can be used with transfer learning - frequently starting from a pre-trained model from the model zoo (see next section), though any MultiLayerNetwork/ComputationGraph can be used.

Link: [Transfer learning examples](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples/tree/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/transferlearning/vgg16)

The main class for transfer learning is [TransferLearning](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/transferlearning/TransferLearning.java). This class has a builder pattern that can be used to add/remove layers, freeze layers, etc.
[FineTuneConfiguration](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/transferlearning/FineTuneConfiguration.java) can be used here to specify the learning rate and other settings for the non-frozen layers.
