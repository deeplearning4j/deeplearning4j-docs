									DL4j is a set of tools for running deep learning workloads. It includes a pytorch/tensorflow 2 like library called samediff. It also contains interop with main stream python tools via import from tensorflow and keras. This allows easy deployment in to enterprise environments. Our core c++ codebase libnd4j is also very small and easy to extend set of math operations compilable on a wide variety of architectures. Lastly, dl4j contains a very easy to use spark integration allowing for distributed training and batch inference over a cluster on both cpus and gpus.
